This film is quiet but brutal in what it teaches: institutions can fail quickly, and ordinary people pay first. It reframes war away from strategy maps and toward children, food, shelter, and dignity.

The worldview upgrade here is practical compassion. You are not just "feeling sad"; you are training to understand vulnerability, dependence, and preparedness.
