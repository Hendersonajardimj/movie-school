A block in Brooklyn becomes a pressure cooker, and every character is operating under forces bigger than themselves: money, heat, race, policing, pride, and belonging. The point is not to find one villain. The point is to notice systems producing predictable friction.

If you can train yourself to ask "what incentives and constraints are in play?" your worldview levels up fast. This week is about seeing context before reacting.
